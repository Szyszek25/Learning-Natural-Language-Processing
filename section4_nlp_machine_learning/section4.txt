machine learning:

supervised - using historical data to predict future
*regression = helps you predict a continuous variable such as house prices or temperature
- Linear Regression
- Regularized regression
- Time series Analysis
*classification = helps you predict a caterogical variable such as spam - not spam, high priority vs low priority
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Gradient Boosted Tree
- Naive Bayes - i to omówimy, works really well for text classification


unsupervised - using patterns and relationshipsto find matchings
- K-Means clustering
- Hierarchical clustering
- DBSCAN
- Isolation Forests
- Principal Component Analysis
- t-SNE
- Singular Value Decomposition
- Non-Negative Matrix Factorization - to omówimy, for topic modelling

Sentiment Analysis - technique: Rules-Based, Library: VADER, input format: raw text
Text classification: technique: supervised learning(i.e Naive Bayes), library scikit-learn, input format: CV/ TF-IDF
Topic modelling: technique: unsupervised learning(i.e NMF), library scikit-learn, input format: CV/ TF-IDF
